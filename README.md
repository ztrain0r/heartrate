# heartrate-monitor
The purpose of this project is for a user to be able to read their current heart rate.
How it works: ESP32 hooked up with KS0015 Keyestudio Pulse Rate Monitor reads heart rate and sends it to app. The app then determines if the inputted user heart rate is healthy or not based off age. In the case that the user's heartrate is not healthy, the app gives possible remedies for their situation.
